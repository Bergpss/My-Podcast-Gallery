# Usability Findings — User Story 1

## Participants & 5-Second Recognition
- **Participant A**: Identified the gallery purpose in 4 seconds; praised the concise tagline and curated framing.
- **Participant B**: Needed 6 seconds; suggested adding a “Listen now” hint near the primary link for clarity.
- **Participant C**: Identified the site in 5 seconds; immediately interacted with the sensitive cover control.

## Observations
- Gallery cards feel comfortable on mobile, though participants expect tag metadata for deeper context.
- Sensitive cover messaging successfully prevented accidental exposure while keeping reveal control discoverable.
- The status banner provided reassurance when the gallery loaded on a slower network.

## Follow-Up Actions
- Explore adding genre tags or duration snippets for faster scanning (future story).
- Consider inline microcopy next to the external link to reinforce that it opens the official site.
- Continue monitoring sensitive cover interactions during future usability passes.
