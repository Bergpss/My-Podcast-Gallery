# Feature Specification: Personal Podcast Gallery

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`  
**Created**: 2025-10-13  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to build a podcasts list website. It should contain the list of podcasts that I listen to. The website shows the cover image of podcats and its title and description. All the infomations are gotten from DeoDB"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Browse my podcast gallery (Priority: P1)

As a podcast listener, I want to open the site and immediately see the shows I follow so I can scan their covers, titles, and short descriptions in one place.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value of the site—without the gallery view, the experience delivers no benefit.

**Independent Test**: Load the gallery with the curated NeoDB UUID list and confirm every podcast card displays cover image, title, description, and an external link or action for deeper exploration.

> Constitution alignment: Covers <=360 px, 768 px, >=1200 px gallery layouts; validates NeoDB UUID coverage for the curated list; records accessibility and performance evidence for the basic gallery load.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the curated list of podcast UUIDs, **When** the visitor loads the site with a healthy NeoDB response, **Then** they see each podcast card with cover image, title, description, and an action leading to more information.
2. **Given** the same curated list, **When** NeoDB returns an error or slow response, **Then** the visitor sees a friendly status message while the layout remains stable and offers a retry option.

### User Story 2 - Enjoy the gallery on any device (Priority: P2)

As a listener on the go, I want the gallery to feel polished on my phone, tablet, or desktop so I can browse comfortably wherever I am.

**Why this priority**: Responsiveness ensures the gallery is useful across the devices the owner and their friends actually use to listen and share.

**Independent Test**: Review the gallery at <=360 px, 768 px, and >=1200 px widths and confirm readability, interaction affordances, and spacing remain consistent.

> Constitution alignment: Verifies responsive breakpoints and accessibility states (focus outlines, tap targets) across devices; captures performance evidence on mobile and desktop profiles.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the gallery content, **When** the site is viewed on a device 360 px wide, **Then** tiles stack or resize so text remains legible without horizontal scrolling.
2. **Given** the same gallery, **When** the site is viewed on a desktop >=1200 px, **Then** multiple columns display with appropriate spacing and imagery retains clarity.

### User Story 3 - Keep podcast details accurate (Priority: P3)

As the gallery curator, I want the site to pull live data from NeoDB so the covers, titles, and descriptions stay current without manual edits.

**Why this priority**: Automated data ensures the gallery remains trustworthy and reduces maintenance overhead for the owner.

**Independent Test**: Trigger data fetches for a sample of UUIDs, validate the displayed values against NeoDB, and simulate API errors to confirm graceful recovery.

> Constitution alignment: Confirms NeoDB remains the single source of truth, demonstrates error handling resilience, and documents evidence of data accuracy checks.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the list of podcast UUIDs, **When** the site refreshes data from NeoDB, **Then** updated titles, descriptions, and cover images appear without code changes.
2. **Given** the same list, **When** NeoDB returns incomplete metadata, **Then** the gallery substitutes fallbacks (e.g., placeholder image, truncated copy) while flagging the issue for review.

## Assumptions

- "DeoDB" in the request refers to NeoDB, the existing source for podcast metadata used across the project.
- The owner maintains a finite list of podcast UUIDs (fewer than 100) that represent their current listening habits.
- Visitors access the site without authentication, and all podcasts are appropriate for a public-facing gallery.

## Edge Cases

- NeoDB request times out, fails authentication, or returns incomplete metadata for one or more podcasts.
- A podcast cover image is missing, uses an unexpected aspect ratio, or contains sensitive imagery requiring a default blur overlay and warning badge before reveal.
- The curated list temporarily becomes empty (all podcasts removed or filtered) and the gallery must communicate the state.
- Devices narrower than 320 px or ultra-wide monitors above 1600 px display the gallery; typography and layout must remain legible, with validation evidence captured at 300 px and 1800 px widths.
- Visitor revisits the site shortly after a NeoDB update; cached content should refresh without confusing flicker or stale details.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The gallery MUST display each selected podcast with its cover image, title, concise description, and a clear action leading to an external listening destination, applying a blur overlay and warning badge to any curator-flagged sensitive cover art before reveal.
- **FR-002**: Podcast data MUST be retrieved from NeoDB using the maintained UUID list; the experience must not rely on manually duplicated metadata.
- **FR-003**: The gallery layout MUST remain usable at <=360 px, 768 px, and >=1200 px widths, preserving readable typography, spacing, and interaction targets.
- **FR-004**: The experience MUST uphold accessibility fundamentals, including descriptive alt text, logical heading structure, keyboard navigation, and visible focus states.
- **FR-005**: When NeoDB data is delayed or unavailable, the site MUST present informative loading or error states while allowing visitors to retry without breaking the layout.
- **FR-006**: The overall experience MUST be deliverable as a static site suitable for hosting without server-side processing, in line with project governance.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Podcast**: Metadata sourced from NeoDB (uuid, title, description, official_site, image_url, tags) with curator-managed metadata in `src/data/podcasts.json` including a `sensitive` boolean used to trigger blur overlays.
- **Podcast Collection**: Curated list owned by the site creator, defining which podcast UUIDs appear and in what order visitors see them.
- **Status Message**: Structured content used to inform visitors about loading, empty-state, or error conditions without disrupting the gallery layout.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-13

- Q: How will the curator flag sensitive podcast cover art that should receive the blur overlay? → A: Add a `sensitive` boolean per podcast entry in `src/data/podcasts.json`.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Moderated usability sessions with at least three representative listeners confirm 100% of participants identify a familiar podcast within 5 seconds on first load, with observations logged in `docs/evidence/US1/usability.md`.
- **SC-002**: Design reviews across <=360 px, 768 px, and >=1200 px viewports report no readability or interaction issues, confirmed by responsive audit sign-off.
- **SC-003**: Independent accessibility evaluation documents zero critical or serious issues and fewer than three minor findings for the gallery experience.
- **SC-004**: Nightly metadata audits over a rolling 30-day window log that 95% of podcast cards match the latest NeoDB titles and descriptions within 24 hours, with evidence stored in `docs/maintenance/metadata-audit.md`.
- **SC-005**: Performance reviews confirm the gallery becomes visibly usable within 2 seconds on standard broadband connections for 90% of test sessions.
