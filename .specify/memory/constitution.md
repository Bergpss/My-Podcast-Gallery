# My Podcast Gallery Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Framework-Free Static Delivery
- The site MUST be authored with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; client-side frameworks or component libraries that inject runtime dependencies are prohibited.
- Build tooling MAY bundle or minify assets but MUST output static files deployable through any static host without server execution.
- The repository MUST exclude backend runtimes; all dynamic data is retrieved via browser requests against public APIs.

*Rationale: Guarantees a lightweight deploy-anywhere gallery aligned with the static-site mandate.*

### II. Responsive Layout Fidelity
- Layouts MUST follow a mobile-first approach with confirmed breakpoints for <=360 px, ~768 px, and >=1200 px widths, maintaining readability without horizontal scrolling.
- Components MUST leverage CSS Grid or Flexbox with fluid typography and spacing; fixed pixel widths that break responsiveness are not allowed.
- Interactive elements MUST remain operable via touch, keyboard, and pointer inputs across supported viewport sizes.

*Rationale: Delivers a consistent, device-agnostic experience for podcast discovery.*

### III. NeoDB Data Authority
- Podcast metadata MUST be fetched from the NeoDB API using the supplied NeoDB UUID; duplicating data in source files beyond type definitions is forbidden.
- The client MUST handle API latency or failure with resilient loading and error states that preserve layout integrity.
- API access MUST honor NeoDB rate limits and rely on environment-configured base URLs or tokens without hardcoding secrets.

*Rationale: Preserves a single source of truth for content accuracy and maintainability.*

### IV. Accessible Modern Presentation
- Visual styling MUST meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios, with semantic HTML structure and ARIA attributes only when necessary for assistive clarity.
- All media assets MUST provide meaningful alt text or explicit decorative markers; non-text content requires accessible fallbacks.
- Focus states, reduced-motion preferences, and color scheme choices MUST be respected throughout the design system.

*Rationale: Marries contemporary aesthetics with inclusive access for every listener.*

### V. Performance Budget Discipline
- Combined initial HTML, CSS, and JavaScript payload MUST stay under 200 KB gzipped; imagery MUST be optimized (WebP/AVIF preferred) and lazy-loaded when offscreen.
- Typography MUST default to system font stacks or locally hosted subsets; third-party scripts demand documented approval tied to user value.
- Each release MUST capture automated Lighthouse (or equivalent) audits targeting scores >=90 for Performance and Best Practices.

*Rationale: Maintains fast first paint and smooth browsing on constrained networks.*

## Implementation Standards

- Project structure MUST remain within a single `src/` directory containing `index.html`, `styles/`, `scripts/`, `assets/`, and optional `dist/` output generated by build tooling; no additional runtime directories are allowed.
- Environment variables powering NeoDB requests MUST be declared in `.env.example` and injected at build time through lightweight tooling (e.g., esbuild define replaces) without committing live secrets.
- HTTP requests MUST flow through `scripts/api.js`, which standardizes timeouts, error normalization, and opt-in caching via `localStorage` while honoring user privacy settings.
- Styling MUST centralize theme tokens in `styles/theme.css` and reuse utility classes for spacing, typography, and color to keep the presentation coherent and maintainable.

## Delivery Workflow

- Feature specifications MUST map each user story to the relevant core principle(s) and document required breakpoints, data interactions, and accessibility checks.
- Implementation plans MUST pass a Constitution Check verifying static asset compliance, responsive breakpoint coverage, NeoDB integration design, and accessibility/performance validation strategy before coding starts.
- Pull requests MUST attach evidence: responsive screenshots (<=360 px, 768 px, >=1200 px), latest Lighthouse report, and accessibility scan output (e.g., axe-core or WAVE) captured against the feature branch build.
- Deployment artifacts MUST be generated via a reproducible `npm run build` (or equivalent) command that outputs only static files and is validated before merge.

## Governance

- This constitution supersedes conflicting process documents within the repository; any disagreement is resolved in favor of these principles.
- Amendments require a documented pull request describing the change, updated versioning per this section, refreshed templates as needed, and approval from the core maintainer group (majority of owners).
- Versioning follows semantic rules: MAJOR for breaking principle changes, MINOR for new principles or substantive expansions, PATCH for clarifications; each amendment MUST update the Sync Impact Report and related templates.
- Compliance reviews occur on every pull request; maintainers MUST verify adherence to the core principles, rerun required audits, and reject changes lacking mandated evidence.
- An annual retrospective each October MUST reaffirm relevance of the principles, capturing decisions in the repository's docs or triggering amendments if adjustments are required.
