# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

> Constitution alignment: Document the responsive breakpoints exercised (<=360 px, 768 px, >=1200 px), the NeoDB UUIDs involved, and the accessibility/performance evidence the story will produce.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- What happens when the NeoDB API request times out, fails authentication, or returns incomplete fields?
- How does the layout behave on devices narrower than 320 px or wider than 1440 px?
- What feedback is shown if performance audits fall below the >=90 Lighthouse target?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST request podcast metadata from NeoDB using the provided UUID and render the response fields (title, description, official_site).
- **FR-002**: System MUST render a responsive layout that preserves usability at <=360 px, 768 px, and >=1200 px viewports.
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to browse podcast cards with accessible keyboard navigation and descriptive alt text.
- **FR-004**: System MUST display resilient loading and error states when NeoDB data is unavailable.
- **FR-005**: System MUST serve static assets only (HTML, CSS, JS) via the documented build command.

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **FR-006**: System MUST keep the initial payload under 200 KB gzipped [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: identify asset optimization strategy].
- **FR-007**: System MUST log Lighthouse scores >=90 for Performance and Best Practices [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specify audit tooling and frequency].

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Podcast**: Metadata sourced from NeoDB (uuid, title, description, official_site, image_url, tags).
- **Gallery View**: Presentation layer grouping podcasts by category or personal list ordering.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: [Responsive validation] Gallery maintains layout without overflow at <=360 px, 768 px, >=1200 px.
- **SC-002**: [Accessibility metric] Axe-core scan reports zero critical violations across key pages.
- **SC-003**: [Performance metric] Lighthouse Performance and Best Practices scores remain >=90 on the primary view.
- **SC-004**: [Data freshness] NeoDB fetch succeeds within [target e.g., 800 ms] for 95% of requests during testing.
