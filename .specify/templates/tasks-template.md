# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: The examples below include test tasks. Tests are OPTIONAL - only include them if explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Static site assets live under `src/` (e.g., `src/index.html`, `src/styles/`, `src/scripts/`, `src/assets/`)
- Build artifacts output to `dist/` via `npm run build` (or equivalent) and MUST remain static

<!-- 
  ============================================================================
  IMPORTANT: The tasks below are SAMPLE TASKS for illustration purposes only.
  
  The /speckit.tasks command MUST replace these with actual tasks based on:
  - User stories from spec.md (with their priorities P1, P2, P3...)
  - Feature requirements from plan.md
  - Entities from data-model.md
  - Endpoints from contracts/
  
  Tasks MUST be organized by user story so each story can be:
  - Implemented independently
  - Tested independently
  - Delivered as an MVP increment
  
  DO NOT keep these sample tasks in the generated tasks.md file.
  ============================================================================

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Create `src/` scaffold with `index.html`, `styles/`, `scripts/`, `assets/`
- [ ] T002 Configure lightweight build tooling (e.g., esbuild, Vite static mode) to output `dist/`
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure formatting, stylelint/eslint, and Lighthouse CI baselines

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

Examples of foundational tasks (adjust based on your project):

- [ ] T004 Implement `scripts/api.js` with NeoDB fetch wrapper, timeout, and error shaping
- [ ] T005 [P] Define `.env.example` and build-time injection for NeoDB API base URL/token
- [ ] T006 [P] Establish global CSS tokens in `styles/theme.css` (colors, spacing, typography)
- [ ] T007 Create base components/partials (e.g., header, footer, podcast card template)
- [ ] T008 Configure accessibility testing (axe-core CLI or equivalent) and Lighthouse automation hooks
- [ ] T009 Document responsive breakpoints and testing matrix in `docs/breakpoints.md`

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - [Title] (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 1 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ‚ö†Ô∏è

**NOTE: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation**

- [ ] T010 [P] [US1] Axe accessibility scan scripted via `npm run test:accessibility` targeting `dist/index.html`
- [ ] T011 [P] [US1] Lighthouse performance audit capturing >=90 scores

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Build podcast gallery markup in `src/index.html` with semantic sections
- [ ] T013 [P] [US1] Implement gallery styling in `src/styles/gallery.css` using CSS Grid
- [ ] T014 [US1] Wire NeoDB fetch and render logic in `src/scripts/gallery.js`
- [ ] T015 [US1] Implement resilient loading/error UI states for the gallery
- [ ] T016 [US1] Capture responsive screenshots for <=360 px, 768 px, >=1200 px viewports
- [ ] T017 [US1] Update docs with usage instructions and compliance evidence

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - [Title] (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 2 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ‚ö†Ô∏è

- [ ] T018 [P] [US2] Accessibility regression script covering new interactive elements
- [ ] T019 [P] [US2] Performance regression audit ensuring payload remains <=200 KB

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T020 [P] [US2] Extend `src/scripts/api.js` for caching or filtering enhancements
- [ ] T021 [US2] Add new layout or section in `src/index.html` (e.g., featured highlights)
- [ ] T022 [US2] Style additions in `src/styles/theme.css` while respecting token system
- [ ] T023 [US2] Update documentation and screenshots reflecting new story

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - [Title] (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 3 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ‚ö†Ô∏è

- [ ] T024 [P] [US3] Accessibility regression for additional components or interactions
- [ ] T025 [P] [US3] Performance/lighthouse comparison before vs. after enhancements

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T026 [P] [US3] Introduce additional view or filter UI in `src/index.html`
- [ ] T027 [US3] Add supporting script in `src/scripts/[feature].js` keeping bundle under budget
- [ ] T028 [US3] Update CSS in `src/styles/[feature].css` ensuring responsive behavior

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

[Add more user story phases as needed, following the same pattern]

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [ ] TXXX [P] Documentation updates in docs/
- [ ] TXXX Code cleanup and refactoring while maintaining static output
- [ ] TXXX Performance optimization across all stories (image compression, code splitting)
- [ ] TXXX [P] Additional automated accessibility/performance checks
- [ ] TXXX Security hardening (CSP headers, dependency review for tooling)
- [ ] TXXX Run quickstart.md validation

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
- Or sequentially in priority order (P1 -> P2 -> P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Automated accessibility and performance scripts MUST be prepared and observed failing before implementation work begins.
- Static markup updates in `src/index.html` precede styling changes in `src/styles/`.
- Styling updates precede JavaScript enhancements in `src/scripts/`.
- Responsive screenshots and audit evidence are captured before marking the story complete.

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch compliance checks for User Story 1 (if requested):
Task: "npm run test:accessibility -- dist/index.html"
Task: "npm run test:lighthouse -- dist/index.html"

# Parallel file updates for User Story 1:
Task: "Update gallery markup in src/index.html"
Task: "Refine gallery styling in src/styles/gallery.css"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational -> Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 -> Test independently -> Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 -> Test independently -> Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 -> Test independently -> Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
